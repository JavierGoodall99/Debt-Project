            <h2>Debt Statistics</h2>
            <p>South Africa has one of the highest rates of household debt in the world, with many people falling into debt due to a variety of factors, including high unemployment, low income, and a lack of financial literacy. According to a report by the National Credit Regulator (NCR), the total amount of debt owed by South Africans was estimated to be around R1.8 trillion in 2020.
            <br>
            <br>
            Furthermore, a survey conducted by the Debt Counsellors Association of South Africa (DCASA) found that around 90% of the people who seek debt counselling services in South Africa are over-indebted, with an average of 13 credit agreements per person.
            <br>
            <br>
            Additionally, the National Credit Act (NCA) in South Africa, which was implemented in 2007, aims to protect consumers from reckless lending, but it was reported that many South Africans still fall into debt trap. A study by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) in 2019 revealed that around 70% of credit active consumers in South Africa were in arrears on at least one credit agreement.</p>
